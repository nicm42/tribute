			<div id="timeline-info">I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue was created in 1972 by comedian Graeme Garden, as an 'antidote to panel games'. Four panellists played silly games, partly improvisational, for which no points were ever actually awarded. Its most famous game, Mornington Crescent, is often played on internet forums, to the bemusement of those who have never listened and are confused by the rules.
			<br><br>
			Recently they began a live tour, including the best of the games, which wasn't recorded or broadcast. Tickets to the tour and the recordings can sell out in days, if not minutes.</div>

			<div class="game" id="mornington-crescent"><h4>Mornington Crescent</h4>
				The aim of the game is to reach Mornington Crescent, via other London stations. There are many variations on the rules.</div>
			<div class="game" id="one-song"><h4>One Song to the Tune of Another</h4>
				A game that needs careful explanation. Often one song will be tonally opposite to the tune, for hilarious results.</div>
			<div class="game" id="uxbridge"><h4>Uxbridge English Dictionary</h4>
				Previously known as new definitions. Using the sound of words, panellists come up with new things they could mean.</div>
			<div class="game" id="pants"><h4>In My Pants</h4>
				A new game, designed to make Jack Dee laugh. Panellists call out the name of eg a film, then Jack says "In my pants".</div>
			<div class="game" id="swanee-kazoo"><h4>Swanee Kazoo</h4>
				Never did a duet between two instruments sound so harmonious.</div>
			<div class="game" id="minim"><h4>Just a Minim</h4>
				Singing a song without hesitation, repetition or deviation.</div>
			<div class="game" id="sound-charades"><h4>Sound Charades</h4>
				Charades, but telling a story in order to guess the book/TV series/film.</div>
